## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

During review of the Nigeria houses listing dataset complete the Data Science Blog Post as part of the Udacity Data Scientists Nanodegree Program, I was motivated to better understand and to answer the following questions:

1.	What are the most common real estates listed for sale in Nigeria?
2.	What cities or towns have the most listings?
3.	Where are lowest price and highest price listings and what are the price estimates. 
The Nigeria house dataset describes listing of houses and their prices based on location and other parameters. The original dataset can be found [here]( https://www.kaggle.com/abdullahiyunus/nigeria-houses-and-prices-dataset).

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

1.	Nigeria_Houses.ipynb Jupyter notebook contains explanation, analysis, visuals and answers to the questions stated in the project motivation
2.	nigeria_houses_data.csv  - original dataset in csv format
